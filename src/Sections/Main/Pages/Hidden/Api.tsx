            The api endpoints use other api's to retrieve data and returns them in a more user-friendly 
            format. Rather than having to read the hundred lines everytime, the api endpoint retrieves 
            the data and caches the data for a specific period to reduce the reloading process. Below 
            is a full list of endpoints avaliable.
